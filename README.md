# STONERSI

Welcome to my MERN Stack application which allows you to write any funny post and share your weird ideas and thoughts of any kind.

## Main Technologies:

- React (Styled Components, React Router, hooks)
- Redux
- Node.js (express)
- MongoDB (mongoose)
- Typescript

The idea for this app was from my friend and I thought that this will be excellent opportunity for practicing my skills.

## As a user you can:

- Read all accepted posts
- Sing up
- Sign in
- Write a post
  - as a logged in user
  - even if you are not logged in you can still write a post as anonymous user
  - but every post must be accepted by admin or moderator
- If you are logged in user, you can give a score (light a joint) for any post you like
  - Scores are called "joints to light"
  - Every logged in user has 3 scores which are reseting on every new day
- You can read comments of specific post
- You can write a comment if you are logged in
- You can turn on chill music on the background or you can turn off this
- You can visist "Top 5" page where you can see top 5 posts with the highest scores
- You can also visit "Videos" page or "FAQ" page

## This web app also has a dashboard - only for admin and moderators!

## As an admin you can:

- Visit page on dashboard where you can see all of these not accepted posts yet
  - You can accept specific post or you can reject it
- Visit page on dashboard where you can see all of these rejected posts (by moderator or admin)
  - You can accept specific post or delete it completly
- You have also possibility to delete any comment

## As a moderator you can:
